Plaint for Provence: 1152: Les Baux by Jean Gill Book Review

Name: Anita Kovacevic
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: The calm before the storm and another masterpiece!
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on May 12, 2018
Review: (Warning : this is not going to be a short review. Books like this deserve all the respect a reader can provide. However, for those who enjoy short reviews - this is an etremely intriguing historical fiction about love, life and death. Read it, but it would be a shame to skip the first 2 books in the series.)

It took me a while to completely get into the book. At first I thought it was just my temporary mood, and trusting the process and all of Jean Gill's books I'd read before (especially Song at Dawn and Bladesong, the first two in this series), I knew the story would grab me. And boy, oh boy, did it! To be honest, it is difficult to get it out of my head now.

By the time I was one third into the story, the feeling of the calm before the storm had crawled into my bones, and the faith of the characters seemed to rest solely on my ability to read it all till the end in one single read, which I practically did. And never regretted one second of my book-induced insomnia!

The growth of the characters from book 1 to this one, their relationships, political powerplay and the social changes are followed through perfectly. Estela and Dragonetz are fascinating in their strengths and weaknesses, their entrepreneurial spirit and the way they grow together as a couple but also individually. DeRancon and Hugues keep balancing the see-saw between good decision and wrong choices, constantly pulling at yournerves as they interact with others. Malik, Gilles and Sancha are so strong in their loyalty and staying true to themselves. The rulers, would-be rulers, nobility which is more or less noble, servants who remain below the radar actually pulling the strings from the shadows... all of this is written with precision, perfection and passion.

Just read the initial chapter to see what I mean - the interchange between measly messengers over a drink is so well guided - it shows the author's authoritative command of researched historical facts, beautifully flowing syntax which abides by the vernacular of the time without losing its natural twists and turns, a phenomenal sense of showing the big picture through the simplest details and making history alive and exciting by engaging all of the reader's senses - you can see their faces, smell the stench of travellers robes, hear the hushed voices eager to divulge their information but bound by secrecy, feel their excitement and fear at the impact of their news... And this is just chapter one! (Ending the book with another important messenger situation is a cliffhanger which will make you want to dive into book 4 immeditely.)

The introductions into chapters are something some readers might skip, but I particularly enjoyed them. Again, a sort of calm before the storm. As Estela's interest in science and medicine grows, she reads all sorts of medical texts, which the author shares in introductory paragraphs very briefly, but so up to point that it would be a pity to miss them. Not only do they offer a glimpse into the way people of the time thought and lived, but the remedies and maladies mentioned often serve as an introduction into the events which follow, in a perfectly well-masked manner. The author pays a lot of attention to customs in this book (women's medical issues, hunting and working with birds of prey, money making, etc.), but historical fact never turns this book into a history coursebook. In fact, it serves the story, builds it up and grows naturally with the plots and characters.

The intimate moments between characters, their sensuality, tenderness, debates, concerns, doubts, conflicts make you feel especially privileged to witness. I mean, you get to witness a liege talking to a ruler, a villain whispering a threat into your heroine's ear in plain sight of a full court of noble guests.

After a while, you realize each and every chapter ends on a very cleverly planted cliffhanger which transports you into the next one and then the next one. Let me just repeat my own words from the time when I finished the first book - history has never been more exciting!

I cannot choose my favourite quote or my favourite character, although the punishment Hugues deserves from Estela for his sexual advances is still one of my favourite scenes. No more spoilers, I promise.

The 'calm before the storm' feeling, by the way, stayed with me till the very end, which shows the author's genius as book four is out, so I am definitely getting it. Now!

Title: Brilliant Historical Fiction

Review: ‚ÄúPlaint for Provence‚Äù is the third book in the Troubadors Quartet by Jean Gill. The story continues to follow the troubairitz Estela de Matin and her lover Dragonetz los Pros as they navigate the often troubled waters of political intrigue in medieval France. Now reunited with their infant son Musca and Estela beloved guard dog Nici they have settled into family life in Marselha. But their peaceful existence is soon to be disturbed by the outside world. As the story progresses old friends and enemies return and the maneuvering of those in power as well as those who seek it, plays out against the colorful backdrop of the period.
As with the first two books in the series, this book is well researched. Gill‚Äôs beautifully written descriptions of the region are so engaging it‚Äôs as if the reader has traveled back in time. Along with this are her vibrant images of the characters. Her ability to keep characters lively throughout the series speaks highly of her talent as a writer.
Particularly fascinating in this installment is Estela‚Äôs growing interest in the pharmacopeia of the period. This adds yet another fascinating dimension to the character.
The character of Dragonetz has also developed beautifully. His love for and devotion to Estela has become even more evident giving him a depth that is compelling.
By the end of this portion of the quartet Estela and Dragonetz are fully committed to one another. Each has released the ties of past relationships, family and friends, dedicating themselves to each other, their child, and the true friends who have supported them throughout. Their devotion is inspiring.
Another positive for Ms Gill is her addition of a list of characters and the identification of whether they are real historical figures or fictional characters of her creation. She has interspersed the two so skillfully that it would be difficult to know which was which without this explanation.
Gill is quite skilled at ending her books at a point that leaves the reader eager for more but not disturbed by a sudden jolt of separation. I look forward to the next edition. No one writes historical fiction as well as Jean Gill.

Title: So, so, unsatisfyingly satisfying! MORE please!
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 4, 2017
Review: One of the best historical series I've read! As the consequences of choices from the earlier books come home to roost, the suspense is ratcheted up. . . the knights come to blows, the ladies twist their scarves at their restrictions, innocents are spared and sacrificed, the just find sparse justice, and the Gyptian's words haunt, in this third installment -- and I pray it is an installment and not the end!!! Ms. Gill leaves room for new adventures, but if she doesn't pen them, she has given us plenty of "tale" to give the readers hours and days to create our own, however lackluster they would be. . . Every page has meaning and while we are introduced to new historical figures, which led to more independent research, the story of our Estela and Dragonetz is always at the core. So much is revealed of family and love and treachery and deceit and who can you trust?? We meet those from both our main characters past who drove them to the decisions they had to make to be the persons they are today. You will delightedly, and self righteously, despise some of them, and pray for a change of heart in others! Never sure who will make it out alive, and you hold your breath until the last word. . . with such a surprising twist at the end, reminiscent of HItchcock to me. So glad I discovered this author and PRAY for a continuation of the travels of Estela and Dragonetz, Malik, Sascha, and Gilles, all those despicable sovereigns and their machinations, the commoners and high born whose lives the author weaves together in this lovely medieval tapestry of prose.
